# Jungle Apple Collector

An interactive jungle simulation where a boy collects falling apples while a CNN model (trained in PyTorch) classifies each capture as **good** or **damaged** in real-time. Good apples land in a virtual basket with positive cues, while damaged apples trigger alerts.

## Features

- Pygame-based jungle scene with animated apples, collision detection, and keyboard controls.
- Real-time PyTorch CNN inference on cropped apple sprites.
- UI displaying total, good, and damaged apples plus visual feedback overlays.
- Virtual basket view of recently collected good apples.
- Synthetic-data training pipeline for the CNN (`train_model.py`).

## Requirements

Install dependencies (preferably inside a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the CNN

The provided `train_model.py` script procedurally generates apple images (with and without blemishes), trains a lightweight CNN (`AppleNet`), and saves the weights to `models/apple_cnn.pth`.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

*Output*: `models/apple_cnn.pth` containing:

- `model_state_dict`: trained weights for `AppleNet`.
- `classes`: label ordering (`["damaged", "good"]`).
- `image_size`: preprocessing hint for the runtime classifier.

The model achieves >90% validation accuracy on the synthetic validation split in a few seconds on CPU.

## Running the Game

After training (and ensuring `models/apple_cnn.pth` exists):

```bash
python game.py
```

Controls: Arrow keys or `A/D` to move left/right.

Gameplay loop:

1. Apples spawn from the canopy, rotate, and fall.
2. When the boy catches an apple, the sprite surface is passed to the CNN via `AppleQualityClassifier`.
3. Good apples increment the green score, animate into the basket, and tint the scene green.
4. Damaged apples raise a “Not a good apple” alert with a red flash.

UI (top panel) always shows total, good, and damaged counts.

## Extending

- Replace the synthetic dataset with real apple photos by editing `SyntheticAppleDataset`.
- Swap in higher fidelity art by dropping image files into `assets/` and updating sprite loaders.
- Integrate sound effects (Pygame `mixer`) for successful / failed catches.
